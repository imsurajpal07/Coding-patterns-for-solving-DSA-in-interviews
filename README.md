# Coding Patterns for Solving DSA in Interviews
A comprehensive collection of essential coding patterns and algorithmic techniques for technical interviews. This repository provides structured approaches to solve data structure and algorithm problems commonly encountered in coding interviews.

## 📚 Pattern Overview
This repository focuses on proven problem-solving patterns that help identify the right approach for different types of algorithmic challenges. Each pattern includes detailed explanations, implementation strategies, and real-world applications.

## 🚀 Available Patterns

### 1. [Sliding Window](./Sliding%20Window.md)
The sliding window technique is used for problems involving arrays or strings where you need to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size. This pattern maintains a subset of items as your window and resize/move that window within the larger list until you find the solution.

**Key Applications:**
- Finding maximum/minimum subarray sums
- Longest substring problems
- Character frequency problems
- Fixed-size window calculations

### 2. [Two Pointers](./Two%20pointers.md)
The two pointers technique uses two pointers to iterate through the data structure in tandem until one or both pointers hit a certain condition. This pattern is useful when searching for pairs in a sorted array or linked list.

**Key Applications:**
- Pair sum problems
- Palindrome verification
- Array partitioning
- Cycle detection in linked lists
- Merging sorted arrays

### 3. [Kadane's Algorithm](./Kadane's%20Algo)
Kadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming approach used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array. This efficient algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity and is particularly useful for solving maximum subarray problems. The algorithm maintains a running sum and tracks the maximum sum encountered so far.

**Key Applications:**
- Maximum subarray sum problems
- Stock profit maximization
- Finding optimal contiguous sequences
- Dynamic programming optimization problems

## 💡 How to Use This Repository
1. **Start with Pattern Study**: Begin by understanding each pattern's core concept and when to apply it
2. **Practice Implementation**: Work through the examples provided in each pattern file
3. **Identify Pattern Types**: Learn to recognize which pattern fits different problem types
4. **Apply in Interviews**: Use these patterns as mental frameworks during coding interviews

## 🎯 Interview Strategy
When approaching a new problem:
1. **Analyze the problem** - What type of data structure is involved?
2. **Identify the pattern** - Does it fit sliding window, two pointers, or another pattern?
3. **Plan your approach** - Outline the algorithm before coding
4. **Implement efficiently** - Use the pattern's standard approach
5. **Test and optimize** - Verify with examples and discuss time/space complexity

## 📈 Complexity Analysis
Each pattern is designed to optimize:
• Time Complexity: Reducing nested loops and unnecessary iterations
• Space Complexity: Minimizing additional data structure usage
• Code Clarity: Writing clean, readable, and maintainable solutions

Happy Coding! 🎉
